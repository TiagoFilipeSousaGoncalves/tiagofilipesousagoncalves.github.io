    abstract={{Pollutant emissions from passenger cars give rise to harmful effects on human health and the environment. Predicting traffic flow is a challenging problem, but essential to understand what factors influence car traffic and what measures should be taken to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In this work, we developed a predictive model to forecast traffic flow in several locations in the city of Porto for 24Â h later, i.e., the next day at the same time. We trained a XGBoost Regressor with multi-modal data from 2018 and 2019 obtained from traffic and weather sensors of the city of Porto and the geographic location of several points of interest. The proposed model achieved a mean absolute error, mean square error, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and Pearson correlation coefficient equal to 80.59, 65395, 0.9162, and 0.7816, respectively, when tested on the test set. The developed model makes it possible to analyse which areas of the city of Porto will have more traffic the next day and take measures to optimise this increasing flow of cars. One of the ideas present in the literature is to develop intelligent traffic lights that change their timers according to the expected traffic in the area. This system could help decrease the levels of carbon dioxide emitted and therefore decrease its harmful effects on the health of the population and the environment.}},
