  ABSTRACT = {The main aim of breast cancer conservative treatment is the optimisation of the aesthetic outcome and, implicitly, women’s quality of life, without jeopardising local cancer control and overall survival. Moreover, there has been an effort to try to define an optimal tool capable of performing the aesthetic evaluation of breast cancer conservative treatment outcomes. Recently, a deep learning algorithm that integrates the learning of keypoints’ probability maps in the loss function as a regularisation term for the robust learning of the keypoint localisation has been proposed. However, it achieves the best results when used in cooperation with a shortest-path algorithm that models images as graphs. In this work, we analysed a novel algorithm based on the interaction of deep image segmentation and deep keypoint detection models capable of improving both state-of-the-art performance and execution-time on the breast keypoint detection task.},
