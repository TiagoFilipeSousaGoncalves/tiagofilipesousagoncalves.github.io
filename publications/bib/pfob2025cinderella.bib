    abstract = {{Background: The CINDERELLA Project introduces an innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool, the CINDERELLA APP, designed to enhance the shared decision-making process in breast cancer treatment. This clinical trial aims to assess the Digital Health intervention’s effectiveness in improving patient satisfaction with locoregional treatment aesthetic outcomes, aligning patient expectations with actual results, and evaluating its influence on overall quality of life and psychological well-being. The adoption and utilization of digital health applications in this context have not been extensively explored, making this study crucial for evaluating the app’s acceptability, usability, clinical impact and patients’ satisfaction. This work specifically addresses patient engagement and usage patterns of the CINDERELLA APP within the interventional arm of the trial during the first ten months of recruitment. Methods: The CINDERELLA Trial is an international, multicenter, interventional, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical study. Patients with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer and no signs of systemic disease are enrolled and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention arm utilizes the CINDERELLA APP, which leverages AI and digital health technologies to provide patients with comprehensive information (i.e., text, images, videos) about existing and proposed locoregional treatments, including photographs of similar cases treated with the same surgical techniques. Data collection encompassed patient demographics and app usage metrics (i.e., duration, logins, content engagement). Comparative analyses of app usage time across different patient subgroups were conducted using the Wilcoxon or Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test. Statistical analysis was conducted using R 4.4.1 for Windows and RStudio (2024.04.2). The CANKADO platform was the primary digital platform for physicians to manage the app content and collect data, ensuring adherence to privacy, data protection, and ethical guidelines in AI applications. Results: The clinical trial recruited 474 patients from August 8, 2023, to June 30, 2024, across seven study sites in five countries. Of these, 246 patients, with a median age of 53 years, were randomized to the interventional arm. The average app usage duration was 19.25 minutes (min) with a median of 4 logins/user, over a median follow-up period of 3.2 months. Israel recorded the lowest app usage time with an average of 10.26 min and a median of 1.5 logins/user, while Poland recorded the highest with 24.68 min and a median of 6 logins/user. There were no statistically significant differences in median app usage time based on age groups (\&lt;40 years, 6.55 min vs. 40-60 years, 11.8 min vs. \&gt;60 years, 14.17 min, p=0.136) or estimated type of surgery (11.58 min for breast-conserving surgery vs. 11.68 min for mastectomy with reconstruction, p=0.721). Noteworthy, patients expected to undergo radiotherapy used the app longer than their counterparts (12.81 min vs 9.06 min, p=0.034). The “Frequently Asked Questions” section was the most accessed part of the app, accounting for 44.61\% of the total 3201 hits. Conclusions: Initial data indicate good engagement with the CINDERELLA APP. The presence of only minor differences in usage patterns across countries, age groups, and treatment types suggests that the app may play a role in filling the informative gaps related to patients’ characteristics. The CINDERELLA Trial is ongoing, with final results predicted to be published in 2026 once recruitment and follow-up have been concluded. These initial findings regarding the app’s usability, together with the trial’s final results will inform enhancements to design AI-based clinical decision support systems to better meet patient needs and improve decision-making processes in breast cancer treatment.
