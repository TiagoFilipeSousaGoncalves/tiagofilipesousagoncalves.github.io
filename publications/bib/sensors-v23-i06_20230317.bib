    abstract = {Semantic segmentation consists of classifying each pixel according to a set of classes. Conventional models spend as much effort classifying easy-to-segment pixels as they do classifying hard-to-segment pixels. This is inefficient, especially when deploying to situations with computational constraints. In this work, we propose a framework wherein the model first produces a rough segmentation of the image, and then patches of the image estimated as hard to segment are refined. The framework is evaluated in four datasets (autonomous driving and biomedical), across four state-of-the-art architectures. Our method accelerates inference time by four, with additional gains for training time, at the cost of some output quality.},
