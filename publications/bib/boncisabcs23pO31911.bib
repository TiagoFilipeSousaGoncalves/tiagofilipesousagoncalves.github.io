    abstract = {{Background. Breast cancer treatment has improved overall survival rates, with different locoregional approaches offering patients similar locoregional control but variable aesthetic outcomes that may lead to disappointment and poor quality of life (QoL). There are no standardized methods for informing patients of the different therapies prior to intervention, nor validated tools for evaluation of aesthetics and patients' expectations. The CINDERELLA Project is based on years of research and developments of new healthcare technologies by various partners, aimed to provide an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to aid shared decision-making by showing breast cancer patients the predicted aesthetic outcomes of their locoregional treatment. The clinical trial will evaluate the use of this tool within an AI cloud-based platform approach (CINDERELLA App) versus a standard approach. We anticipate that the CINDERELLA App will lead to improved satisfaction, psychosocial well-being and health-related QoL while maintaining the quality of care and providing environmental and economic benefits.Trial design. CINDERELLA is an international multicentric interventional randomized controlled open-label clinical trial. Using the CINDERELLA App, the AI and Digital Health arm will provide patients with complete information about the proposed types of locoregional treatments and photographs of similar patients previously treated with the same techniques. The Control arm will follow the standard approach of each clinical site. Randomization will be conducted online using the digital health platform CANKADO, ensuring a balanced distribution of participants between the two groups. CANKADO is the underlying platform through which physicians control the patients' app content and conduct all data collection. Privacy, data protection and ethical principles in AI usage were taken into account.Eligibility criteria. Patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer without evidence of systemic disease. All patients must sign an informed consent and be able to use a web-based app autonomously or with home-based support.Specific aims. Primary objective: to assess the levels of agreement among patients' expectations regarding the aesthetic outcome before and 12 months after locoregional treatment. The trial will also evaluate the aesthetic outcome level of agreement between the AI evaluation tool and self-evaluation. Secondary objectives: health-related QoL (EQ-5D-5L and BREAST-Q ICHOM questionnaires) and resource consumption (e.g., time spent in the hospital, out-of-pocket expenses). The questionnaires and photographs will be applied prior to any treatment, at wound healing, at 6 and 12 months following the completion of locoregional therapy.Statistical methods. Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to assess the intervention's impact on the agreement level between expectations and obtained results. Weighted Cohen's kappa will be calculated to measure the improvement in classifying aesthetic results with intervention. Statistical tests and/or bootstrap techniques will compare results between arms. A similarity measure will be calculated between self-evaluation and outcome obtained with the AI tool for each participant, and a beta regression model will be used to analyze the intervention's effect. Secondary objectives will be evaluated by scoring questionnaires based on provided guidelines.Target accrual. The clinical trial, led by Champalimaud Clinical Centre, will enroll a minimum of 515 patients in each arm between July 2023 and January 2025. Recruitment is currently open at five study sites in Germany, Israel, Italy, Poland and Portugal. The clinical trial is still open for further international study sites.Funding.
